Working example for Storybook issue [#26220](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/26220).

Setup:

1. Run `pnpm install`
2. Run `cd apps/storybook`
3. Run `pnpm storybook` to start Storybook

## Notes

I omitted a build step for the `ui` package intentionally so its easier to follow this example.
